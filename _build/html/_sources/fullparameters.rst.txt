Complete Parameters description 
===============================

Each possible program option that can be used in an input file will be listed in
the following few sections of this manual along with a brief explanation of it's
functionality. It should be noted that not every option is required to be included
in an input file, and the user can choose which (if any) are appropriate for
their calculations. Thus, all options, including the input file itself, is optional.
As a result, each variable that can be changed will also have a default value.
